2020 UPDATE
======================

I decided to bring-up the plugin for 1.16.x version and using the REST API of JIRA as since the original plugin was released, it is deprecated.

======================
###What the heck is this?

Hi there! :-) You're now looking at the source code for the [JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/jira/) Plugin for [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net/).


**Minecraft** is an open-world sandbox game in which players mine, craft, explore and build an unlimited world made from blocks of different materials.


**JIRA** is a software application from [Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com/) that lets developers, managers and other team members track their tasks and issues.


Using this plugin when playing Minecraft allows you to keep track of a 'to-do' list in Minecraft by creating and resolving JIRA issues. Win!


##Getting Started

You can download the latest version of the Minecraft JIRA Plugin by going to the [Downloads] section. If you've never setup a Minecraft and/or JIRA Server before, there's also instructions for that in the [Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/jaysee00/minecraftjiraplugin/wiki/Home).

1. Setup a JIRA application [on this site](https://jira.atlassian.com/)
2. Create Custom Fields with names: World, X, Y, Z (All of them text fields, single line)
3. Make them available on all screens
4. Modify config.yml with your API token, username (email), your project key, (if you want to put it under a parent issue, then create it and use it's key as parent, otherwise leave empty), possibly modify the transition numbers (that can be specific to projects, might need to be changed)
