What the heck is this?
======================

Hi there! :-) You're now looking at the source code for the <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/jira">JIRA</a> Plugin for <a href="http://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>.

<strong>Minecraft</strong> is an open-world sandbox game in which players mine, craft, explore and build an unlimited world made from blocks of different materials.

<strong>JIRA</strong> is a software application from <a href="http://www.atlassian.com>Atlassian</a> that lets developers, managers and other team members track their tasks and issues.

Using this plugin when playing Minecraft allows you to keep track of a 'to-do' list in Minecraft by creating and resolving JIRA issues. Win!

Getting Started
===============

You can download the latest version of the Minecraft JIRA Plugin by going to the <a href="/jaysee00/minecraftjiraplugin/downloads">Downloads</a> section. If you've never setup a Minecraft and/or JIRA Server before, there's also instructions for that in the <a href="/jaysee00/minecraftjiraplugin/wiki">Wiki</a>.
